## What is this?

**jv-ytdlp** is a local desktop app that runs on your Windows PC and lets you download videos through a clean browser UI — no command line needed after setup.

Paste a URL → pick quality → download. That's it.

---

## Download — v0.2

Two options are available from the [Releases](https://github.com/EcomineAI/jv-ytdlp/releases/tag/v0.2) page:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `JVDownloader.Setup.0.2.0.exe` | **Recommended.** One-click installer — installs the app, creates a desktop shortcut, and handles everything automatically. |
| `jv-ytdlp-0.2.0-source.zip` | Source code archive. For developers who want to inspect, modify, or build from scratch. Requires Node.js ≥ 18. |

> **Just want to download videos?** Grab the `.exe` installer. No Node.js required.

---

## Features

- Smart quality detection — only shows resolutions the video actually has
- Real-time progress bar with speed, ETA, and fragment counter
- Auto-merges video + audio using ffmpeg into a clean `.mp4`
- Audio-only MP3 mode
- Cancel download mid-way
- Live log console
- Neo-blue UI
- One-click installer — downloads yt-dlp and ffmpeg automatically on first launch

---

## Install (exe — recommended)

1. Download `JVDownloader.Setup.0.2.0.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/EcomineAI/jv-ytdlp/releases/tag/v0.2)
2. Run the installer
3. Launch **JVDownloader** from your desktop or Start Menu
4. On first launch, click **Install Tools** — yt-dlp and ffmpeg download automatically (~30 MB, one time only)
5. Click **Launch App** — done

---

## Build from Source (zip)

For developers only.

### Requirements

- Windows 10 / 11
- Node.js ≥ 18 — [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

---

## Usage

1. Paste a YouTube URL
2. App auto-detects available qualities (~2 sec)
3. Pick quality from the dropdown
4. Optionally change the save folder or toggle MP3 mode
5. Click **DOWNLOAD**
6. File saves to your Downloads folder (or chosen folder)

---

---

## How it works

The app runs a local HTTP server on port `57329`. The Electron window loads the UI from that server. yt-dlp and ffmpeg are downloaded once to `~/.jv-ytdlp/tools/` on first launch and reused on every subsequent run.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Setup screen appears on every launch**
→ yt-dlp or ffmpeg may have failed to download. Click Install Tools again.

**No audio in downloaded video**
→ ffmpeg may not have installed correctly. Re-run setup from the app menu.

**Quality shows only "Best Available"**
→ Format scan failed — download still works using best available quality.

**Windows SmartScreen warning on installer**
→ Expected for unsigned apps. Click "More info" → "Run anyway". The app is open source — inspect the code in the source zip if you'd like to verify.
